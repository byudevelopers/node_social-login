# Social Login in Hapijs

## Setup

Install nodejs on your computer.

Validate that it is installed by typing `node --version` into the console. You should see something like this:

```
v7.3.0
```

Note: As long as you have at least node 5, you should be alright.

Next, navigate to this directory in the console (`cd <directory>`) and run the command `npm install`. This will install Hapijs, bell, and all of their dependencies.
